Hey ho. It's me your friendly neighborhood Roboto and I'd like to contribute some files to your new repo.
That's why I created a file to under your .github folder. So we have some content we can work with.

This PR will contain some files you will need in any repository. Currently its these:

- `.github/renovate.json`
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`

It would be great to merge these so renovate-bot can start to keep your dependencies up to date and new PRs are assigned to you as a codeowner.

To learn more about [me](#), [renovate-bot](https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com/) and [codeowners](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners) follow the links.
